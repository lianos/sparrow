# The example DGEList included in this package was created from a serialized
# TCGA dataset that is not readily available, but all the subsequent data
# objects were created from the scripts found in:
#
#   * inst/extdata/testdata/setup-testdata.R
#   * inst/extdata/testdata/create-test-SparrowResult.R
#
# In the future, the internal dataset will be removed and we can rely on
# some of the experimental data package available through ExperimentHub or
# as a bioconductor package itself.
