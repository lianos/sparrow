\title{Generates a fake GeneSetDb by sampling from features in a seas input.}
\usage{
randomGeneSetDb(x, n = 10, bias = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an input container to \code{\link[=seas]{seas()}}}

\item{n}{number of genesets}

\item{bias}{column in \code{x} to bias the geneset creation by}

\item{...}{pass through args}
}
\value{
A randomly generated GeneSetDb you can use against \code{x} for testing.
}
\description{
I wrote this because initial fetching from msigdbr can be slow, and also
having some weird crashes in the unit tests of bioc3.14-devel.
}
\details{
This is a helper function for development, and shouldn't be used by normal
users of this package.

\examples{
gdb.rando <- randomGeneSetDb(exampleDgeResult(), 10, bias = "t")
}
