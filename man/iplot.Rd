}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{\link[=SparrowResult]{SparrowResult()}} object}

\item{y}{the name of the gene set collection}

\item{j}{the name of the gene set name}

\item{value}{A string indicating the column name for the value of the
gene-level metadata to plot. Default is \code{"logFC"}. Anoter often used choice
might also be \code{"t"}, to plot t-statistics (if they're in the result). But
this can be any numeric column found in the data.frame returned by
\code{geneSet(x, y, j)}. If this is a named string (vector), then the value in
\code{names(value)} will be used on the axis when plotted.}

\item{type}{plot the distributions as a \code{"density"} plot or \code{"boxplot"}.}

\item{tools}{the tools to display in the rbokeh plot}

\item{main}{A title to display. If not specified, the gene set name
will be used, otherwise you can pass in a custom title, or \code{NULL}
will disable the title altogether.}

\item{with.legend}{Draws a legend to map point color to meaning. There are
three levels a point (gene level statistic) can be color as, "notsig",
"psig", and "sig". "notsig" implies that the FDR >= 10\%, "psig" means that
FDR <= 10\%, but the logFC is "unremarkable" (< 1), and "sig" means
that both the FDR <= 10\% and the logFC >= 1}

\item{shiny_source}{the name of this element that is used in shiny callbacks.
Defaults to \code{"mggenes"}.}

\item{width, height}{the width and height of the output plotly plot}

\item{ggtheme}{a ggplot theme, like the thing returned from
\code{\link[ggplot2:ggtheme]{ggplot2::theme_bw()}}.}

\item{trim}{used to define the upper and lower quantiles to max out the
individual gene statistics in the selected geneset.}

\description{
It is informative to look at the individual log fold changes of the genes
within a gene set to explore the degree to which they (1) are coherent with
respect to each other; and (2) see how the compare to the background
distribution of log fold changes of the entire transcriptome.

You can visualize this behavior via a \code{type = "density"} plot, or a
\verb{type = "boxplot". It is also common to plot either the individual log fold changes }value = "logFC"\verb{or t-statistics}value = "t"`.
