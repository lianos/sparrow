`sparrow` (formerly [multiGSEA](https://github.com/lianos/multiGSEA)) was built
to facilitate the use of gene sets in the analysis of high throughput genomics
data (primarily RNA-seq). Analysts can orchestrate any number of GSEA methods
across a specific contrast using the unified interface provided by the
`seas`. A shiny application is provided via the [sparrow.shiny][] package that
enables the interactive exploration of of GSEA results.

* The `seas` function is a wrapper that orchestrates the execution of any
  number of user-specified gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) over a particular
  experimental contrast of interest. This will create a `SparrowResult`
  object which stores the results of each GSEA method internally, allowing
  for easy query and retrieval.

* A sister [sparrow.shiny][]
  package provides an `explore` function, which is invoked on `SparrowResult`
  objects returned from a call to `seas()`. The shiny application facilitates
  interactive exploration of these GSEA results. This application can also be
  deployed to a shiny server and can be initialized by uploading a serialized
  `SparrowResult` `*.rds` file.

Full details that outline the use of this software package is provided in the
[package's vignette][vignette], however a brief description is outlined below.

# Usage

A subset of the RNA-seq data tumor/normal samples in the BRCA indication from
the TCGA are provided in this package. We will use that data to perform a
"camera" and "fry" gene set enrichment analysis of tumor vs normal samples
using the MSigDB hallmark and c2 gene set collections  with `sparrow::seas()`.

```{r example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(sparrow)
library(dplyr)
gdb <- getMSigGeneSetDb(c('H', 'C2'), species = 'human', id.type = "entrez")
vm <- exampleExpressionSet(dataset = 'tumor-vs-normal', do.voom = TRUE)
mg <- seas(vm, gdb, c("camera", "fry"), design = vm$design, contrast = "tumor")
```

We can view the top "camera" results with the smallest pvalues like so:

```{r}
results(mg, "camera") %>%
  arrange(pval) %>%
  select(collection, name, padj) %>%
  head
```

The shift in expression of the genes within the top gene set can be visualized
with the `iplot` function below. This plot produces interactive graphics, but
rasterized versions are saved for use with this `README` file:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
iplot(mg, 'C2', 'SOTIRIOU_BREAST_CANCER_GRADE_1_VS_3_UP', type = "density")
```

<img src="man/figures/README_iplot_density.png" />

```{r, eval = FALSE}
iplot(mg, 'C2', 'SOTIRIOU_BREAST_CANCER_GRADE_1_VS_3_UP', type = "boxplot")
```

<img src="man/figures/README_iplot_boxplot.png" />

When these plots are rendered in your workspace or an Rmarkdown document,
the user can hover of the genes (dots) to see their name and differential
expression statistics.

For an immersive, interactive way to explore the GSEA results, use the
`sparrow.shiny::explore(mg)` method!

# Installation

The sparrow suite of packages will soon be submitted to bioconductor and
installable via the recommended `BiocManager::install()` mechanism. In the
meantime, you can install the [sparrow.shiny] package from github.

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("lianos/sparrow.shiny")
```
